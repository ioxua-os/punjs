# PunJS

The objective of this package is finding possible puns from a dictionary of words and some search query. Example:

From the dictionary of [Necromancer, Magician, ..., Wizard] and the query "Neeko", PunJS could yield "Neekomancer" as a result.

## Methodology

PunJS is dataset agnostic (obviously), but for reference, it ships with the Open Dictionary [dataset](http://dicionario-aberto.net/) and a couple others

## Running
`npm run fetch`
`npm run query Neeko`
